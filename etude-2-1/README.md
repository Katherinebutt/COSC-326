## Etude 2: Syllable Slam

### Group: 
- Katherine Butt
- Ava Reese 
- Francessca Totty 
- Matt Dixon


## Libarires used:
- For our syllable counter program we used java.util. This library contains the collections framework, legacy collection classes, event model, date and time facilities, internationzation and many micellaneous classes. We used this library in our program to use a scanner for user input.

## Resources used:
- To help us complete our program we used a website called sarahsnippets.com to help us learn the rules of syllable divison. 

## Testing:
- To test out program we used various words to test our syllable counter.
Hello
hi
windows
chimpanzee
smoking
alphabet
running
cross
technology
contradicting
degenerate
fantastic
investment

## How to run:
To run our program please compile by typing into the prompt javac syllable.java, after compiling please type java syllable which should run our program and give you a prompt to enter a word. To end our program please hold down control and press d.

## How we developed as a team:
- For syllable slam we worked well as a team. First of all, we had a MS Teams group chat which we used to call to plan our approach to solve this problem. We did some research on the rules for counting syllables and jotted them down. 
- Then Ava and Katherine worked together to come up with the original program which was submitted and came back with a few things to fix
- Francessca and Matt then worked together and used the feedback we were provided and adapted our program to fix the errors we needed to.
- Overall, our team worked well together with good communication.
