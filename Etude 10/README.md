For this etude we began by understanding what was required to complete a level. We did this by using the first 5 puzzles. From doing this we learnt two things
    1. The aim of the game is to get all the buttons pressed down
    2. Buttons in the same row and column affect each other

Once we had gained this knowledge we then worked together to work through the puzzle required for the etude
which is level 8, 17, and 24
We found level 8 relatively easy and felt this was to do with the layout of the buttons for this level we didn't follow much of a process to find the solution.
However with puzzles 17 and 24 we used a method where for each attempt we wrote down each button we pressed and the order we pressed them as we did it. This allowed us to keep track of what was working and what wasn't. In conlcusion for puzzles 17 and 24 we found the solution using a process of elimiation
