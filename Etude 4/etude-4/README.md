COSC 326 Etude 4 Desert Crossing

For this etude we worked together in one of the COSC labs to work through the questions relating to crossing the desert.
We found that working through the quesitons in order made the next quesiton easier.

Question 1:
This question was one that we had a short debate about. This debate related whether or not using the fuel cans counted as refilling in the end we decided to make the assumption that using the fuel cans did count as refilling.

Question 2,3,4,5:
For the second question we thought that if we should allow for at least double the amount of fuel it would take to cross the desert then we would be on track for a soultion. We found in the end that it took more fuel than expected.
To help us keep track of what fuel we had used and what fuel we had dropped of approximately every 360km we assigned these as roles to different members of the group. This meant that not one person had to try keep on top of all aspects. This was something that we also applied to the remaining questions.
To make find more efficent ways to cross the desert we used questions 2 and 3 as the starting point and worked backwards as a team to work out where we could save fuel and how we could ensure there was no fuel remaining at the end.
For question 5 we then though that any fuel remaining at the end of journey is fuel that we didn't need from the start of the journey so stuck more to our orginial method but just look at removing fuel from the start of journeys.

Resources Used:
To help us complete this etude we used calulators, paper and a google doc.
    - We used calulators to make sure our maths was correct
    - The paper was used to help us keep track of where fuel was and how much fuel was there
    - We used a google doc that was shared to all group members so we could all have input in writing out the steps to get from one end of the desert to the other
