The aim of this program is to translate from simple English sentences to Te Reo MƒÅori sentence

This program uses the basic python progam with no additional modules
The main features of python used in this program are dictionaries and if/else statements which are being used for bounds check and to ensure the correct sections of the sentences are being translated using the correct dictionaries

Testing Strategy:
    To test this program we developed a test file which contains 20 different sentence in English which aimed to check that the dictionaries were working correctly and picking up when there are errors in the English sentences.
    The test file was not created until the basics of the program were working such as successfully taking in an input and splitting the sentence. During this period we were simplying taking input from the console when the program ran.

Resources Used:
    The main resource used to develop this program was the PDF specification document. In particular the table which showed the subjects and the list of verbs that can be used.

Running the Program:
    To run the program ensure that the test file is inside the same folder as the program file. To change the test file used inside the program change the name of the file in main method under the sentences variable.
    Once this is done then run the program using the run button provided by the VS code IDE
